# domopaque-adapter
A black box adapter with a microservices component for external services such as IFTTT, remote.org, google assistant, Tuya etc communicating with a domopaque app in same way of other domopaque physical devices.

First question is: why reinvent the wheel? Many company such as Itead or Tuya cover the fetaures of my smart home project(talk about domopaque) and their products simplify management, however you don't have full control because every single communication passes through their server. About privacy and many other philosophical stuff my project is clean. About DIY stuff my project is open and not less important, you can create your own devices without going through their services.

Purpose of this project (talk about domopaque-adapter) is to create a synergy with other services without breaking the benefits of domopaque project.

Probably this project will create helping by Seneca.js for implementing a horizontal scaling.
